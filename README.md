# Luna 1.1 "Bittersweet Shimmer"

## About
Luna is an open source board software app released under the GPLv3 license. The goal of this project is to be light and small, yet fully functional for a good board. Everything else is up to plugins. Luna is the successor to ModernBB, and allows users to upgrade from FluxBB 1.4 just as easy ModernBB-updates where. For all supported upgrade paths, see below.

## Requirements
 - A webserver
 - PHP 5.2 or later
 - A database
  - MySQL 5.0 or later 
  - SQLite 2
  - PostgreSQL 8.0 or later

## Upgrade paths
Starting with Luna 1.1, you can upgrade from a whole lot more versions of ModernBB (where you could only upgrade from ModernBB 3.7 with Luna 1.0). In fact, all versions of ModernBB are supported, and as a bonus, we also support upgrading from FluxBB 1.4.0 and onwards, for a fule list, see below:

 - **FluxBB support**
  - **FluxBB 1.4**: 1.4.0 and higher
  - **FluxBB 1.5**: all versions supported
 - **ModernBB support**:
  - **ModernBB 1**: all versions supported
  - **ModernBB 2**: all versions supported, excluding ModernBB 2.3-builds
  - **ModernBB 3**: all versions supported
 - **Luna support**:
  - All versions supported

## Recommendations
 - Make use of a PHP accelerator such as APC or XCache
 - Make sure PHP has the zlib module installed to allow Luna to gzip output
