## About
Luna is an open source board software web app released under the GPLv2 license. Our vision is to bring you a small (in size) and light forum solution and to provide an experience that is both desktop-first and mobile-first, as many seem to forget about the first one. Luna is the successor to ModernBB, one of the first forum software projects to provide a full featured build-in mobile experience without compromises.

## Requirements
- A webserver
- PHP 5.3 or later
- A database running either
    - MySQL 5.0 or later
