ModernBB 1.6 Readme
===================

##About
ModernBB is an open source forum application released under the GNU General Public
Licence. It is free to download and use and will remain so. ModernBB was conceived
and designed to be fast and light with less of the "not so essential" features that
some of the other forums have whilst not sacrificing essential functionality or
usability.

##Requirements
 - A webserver
 - PHP 4.4.0 or later
 - A database such as MySQL 4.1.2 or later, PostgreSQL 7.0 or later, or SQLite 2

##Recommendations
 - Make use of a PHP accelerator such as APC or XCache
 - Make sure PHP has the zlib module installed to allow FluxBB to gzip output
