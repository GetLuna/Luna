## About
Luna is an open source board software web app released under the GPLv3 license. Our vision is to bring you a small (in size) and light forum solution and to provide an experience that is both desktop-first and mobile-first, as manny seem to forget about the first one. Luna is the successor to ModernBB, one of the first forum software projects to provide a full featured build-in mobile experience without compromises.
